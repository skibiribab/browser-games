# Static puzzles — product goals

## Who this is for

Players who want **quiet, focused logic** — not collection grinds or PvP. You open sudoku to think; you close it when done.

## Not in scope

- Multiplayer / matchmaking
- Heavy animation or 3D boards
- Large image assets in the repo
- Cross-linking to interactive game docs (different intent)

## Success criteria

- Load a puzzle in under 2 seconds on a static build
- Play entire session without network (after first load)
- Clear error states (“invalid move”, “row complete”)
- One tap to reveal answer with explanation where applicable
